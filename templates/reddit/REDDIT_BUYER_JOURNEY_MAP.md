# Reddit Buyer Journey Map

Maps all possible paths from awareness to decision for B2B services marketed through Reddit. Identifies drop-off points and defines intervention strategies at each stage.

## Journey Overview

```
ENTRY POINTS -> AWARENESS -> INTEREST -> CONSIDERATION -> EVALUATION -> DECISION
   (6 ways)      (engage)    (DM/research)  (book call)    (show up)   (qualified/sign)
```

---

## Entry Points: How They Find You

### 1. Direct Post View
Browsing relevant subreddits -> see your post in feed

**Optimize:** Post when target audience is active (weekday mornings US time), strong title hooks with specific numbers, first 2 sentences must hook.

### 2. Direct Comment View
Someone asks question -> your comment appears -> they read it

**Optimize:** Comment early on rising threads, end with diagnostic questions to drive DMs, use specific numbers for credibility.

### 3. Reddit Search
Search "[your topic] cost" or "[your service] results" -> find your posts

**Optimize:** Use exact problem phrases in titles, keyword-rich first paragraph, long-tail keywords for higher intent.

### 4. LLM Discovery
Ask ChatGPT/Claude "[your topic] strategies reddit" -> AI surfaces your content

**Optimize:** Write comprehensive posts with specific numbers, structure for scannability, educational tone. Growing channel.

### 5. Profile Click-Through
See one comment -> intrigued -> click profile -> read other posts

**Optimize:** Clear profile bio, pin best post, consistent topic focus, 3-5 high-quality posts = credibility threshold.

### 6. Referral / Social Proof
Someone shares your post in Slack/DM -> recipient reads it

**Optimize:** Include shareable stats, controversial but defensible angles, clear value proposition.

## Stage 1: Awareness -> Interest

### Engagement Signals (Ranked by Intent)
1. **DM immediately** (highest) - clear problem, ready to act
2. **Save post** (high) - want to reference later
3. **Comment with question** (medium-high) - engaged but need more info
4. **Upvote only** (low) - useful but not actively looking
5. **Read but no action** (lowest) - browsing, no immediate need

### Drop-Off Reasons
- Title didn't hook
- First 2 sentences didn't deliver
- Content too salesy
- Not their problem right now
- Too vague (no specific numbers)

### Fix It
- Strong title hooks with specific numbers
- Lead with value in first sentence
- Educational tone, not sales
- Proof elements (real results, not claims)
- Easy next step in comments

---

## Stage 2: Interest -> Consideration

### What Makes Them DM You
1. Immediate pain ("we're trying X and failing")
2. Specific question ("how did you get Y% result?")
3. Pricing curiosity ("what do you charge?")
4. Skepticism ("this can't be real")
5. Solution search ("do you do this for clients?")

### Drop-Off Reasons
- Don't know what to DM
- Not ready yet
- Want more proof
- Prefer comment over DM
- Lost interest after reading full post

### Fix It
- Clear CTA in comments ("DM me for the spreadsheet")
- Specific reason to DM (not "DM for more info")
- Answer common questions proactively in comments
- Share additional value in follow-up comments

---

## Stage 3: Consideration -> Evaluation (DM Conversations)

### Path A: Fast Track (High Intent)
**Pattern:** DM -> "I need this" -> qualify -> calendar link -> booked
**Timeline:** 1-3 messages, <1 day

### Path B: Education Track (Medium Intent)
**Pattern:** DM -> "Tell me more" -> explain -> answer questions -> qualify -> calendar link
**Timeline:** 5-10 messages, 1-3 days

### Path C: Skeptic Track (Low-Medium Intent)
**Pattern:** DM -> "Sounds too good" -> address objection -> show proof -> build trust -> calendar
**Timeline:** 10-20 messages, 3-7 days

### Path D: Researcher Track (Low Intent)
**Pattern:** DM -> "Just curious" -> provide info -> they ghost or bookmark
**Timeline:** No booking (or 30-90 days later)

### Drop-Off Reasons
- Too many steps to book
- Unclear value of call
- Not decision-maker
- Budget concerns
- Timing issues
- Competitor moved faster

### Fix It
- One-click booking (Calendly/Cal.com link)
- Clear call description (what they'll get in 30 minutes)
- Transparent pricing in DMs early
- ROI framing based on their metrics
- Easy reschedule option

---

## Stage 4: Evaluation -> Decision (The Call)

### No-Show Prevention
- Calendar invite auto-sent on booking
- 24h reminder email with call prep questions
- 2h reminder email with meeting link
- Easy reschedule option
- Target: 70-80% show-up rate

### On-Call Outcomes

**Qualified + Interested:**
-> Commit to proposal timeline, schedule review call, clarify decision process

**Qualified but Hesitant:**
-> Surface objections, address with data, risk reversal, give time

**Not Qualified:**
-> Be direct about why, give alternative recommendation, leave door open

---

## Stage 5: Decision -> Close

### Proposal Follow-Up Cadence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Send proposal + Loom walkthrough |
| +1 | "Did you get a chance to review?" |
| +3 | Share additional case study + "Want to discuss questions?" |
| +7 | "Should I assume this isn't a priority right now?" |
| +7 (no reply) | Move to 30/60/90 day nurture |

### Close Timelines
- **Fast close** (1-3 days): Clear problem, urgent, decision-maker
- **Considered close** (4-7 days): Internal discussion, minor objections
- **Slow close** (8-30 days): Complex approval, comparing vendors, budget timing

---

## When to Stop Pursuing

1. **3 unreturned follow-ups** post-proposal -> neutralize
2. **Disqualified on call** -> graceful pass with recommendation
3. **Chose competitor** -> "If it doesn't work out, happy to help"
4. **Indefinite timing** -> set specific far-future follow-up
5. **Wasting your time** -> "Let me know when you're ready to move forward"

## Conversion Metrics to Track

### Top of Funnel
- Post views (Reddit analytics)
- Post engagement rate (upvotes / views)

### Middle of Funnel
- DM rate (DMs / post views) - Target: 0.1-0.5%
- DM -> Calendar rate - Target: 40-50%
- DM response time - Target: <2 hours

### Bottom of Funnel
- Show-up rate - Target: 70-80%
- Qualification rate - Target: 60-70%
- Close rate - Target: 30-40%

### Example Full Funnel
```
1,000 post views
-> 5 DMs (0.5% DM rate)
-> 2 calls booked (40% DM->call)
-> 1.5 showed up (75% show-up)
-> 1 qualified (65% qualification)
-> 0.3 signed (30% close rate)
= 0.03% end-to-end conversion
```

## Optimization Priorities (Highest Leverage)

1. **Increase DM rate** - stronger CTAs, more controversial angles, specific giveaways
2. **Improve DM -> call rate** - faster response time, better qualification, clear calendar CTA
3. **Reduce no-shows** - reminder emails, DM confirmation day before, easy reschedule
4. **Increase qualification rate** - pre-qualify in DMs, clear ICP criteria on calendar page
5. **Shorten DM -> call timeline** - respond within 1 hour, send calendar link by message 2-3
