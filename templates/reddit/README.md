## Results These Templates Produce

Real benchmarks from the system that generated these templates:
- 3 posts + 33 comments -> 14 DMs in 4.5 hours
- Infrastructure breakdown post: 8.7k views, 38 upvotes, 45 comments
- DM to call conversion: ~21%

## Key Principles

1. **Value first, always** - never pitch in public comments
2. **Specific numbers** - "2.3% reply rate" not "good results"
3. **Blunt honesty** - challenge wrong approaches, don't soften
4. **Diagnostic questions** - end 70% of comments with a question
5. **DMs are the funnel** - public comments build trust, DMs convert
