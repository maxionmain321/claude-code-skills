# Reddit Comment Voice Guide

A framework for writing high-performing Reddit comments in B2B subreddits. Built from real engagement data across r/coldemail, r/b2bmarketing, r/LeadGeneration, and r/b2bsaas.

## Character Limits
- **Quick responses:** 400-600 characters
- **Authority comments:** 700-850 characters
- **Never exceed:** 900 characters (readability drops off)

## Structural Framework

### Opening (1-2 sentences)
**Pattern:** Establish credibility + challenge assumption OR validate + add context

**Examples:**
- "I run [your business type]"
- "[industry] is brutal for cold email, people get 50 pitches daily saying the same thing"
- "you're overthinking [X] when the real issue is [Y]"

**Rules:**
- Lead with experience relevant to their question
- If they're wrong, say it immediately (don't soften)
- If they're right, validate then go deeper

---

### Body (3-5 sentences)
**Pattern:** Specific insight -> data/example -> why it matters

**Structure:**
1. Main insight (what they're missing)
2. Concrete example or test data
3. Why the common approach fails
4. What works instead (optional - save for closing if diagnostic question coming)

**Rules:**
- Always include specific numbers (percentages, volumes, timeframes)
- Reference real tests/campaigns when possible
- Explain causation not just correlation

---

### Closing (1-2 sentences)
**Two types:**

**Type A - Diagnostic Question (use 70% of time)**
Forces them to reveal more info, keeps conversation going, positions you as helpful

**Examples:**
- "what marketing services are you selling, who's your ideal client?"
- "what city are you targeting and how many [prospects]?"
- "what was your bounce rate on those domains?"

**Type B - Direct Recommendation (use 30% of time)**
When answer is clear-cut and they just need validation

**Examples:**
- "validation costs $200 upfront, but burning domains costs $800 replacement plus 21 days rewarming"
- "realistic cost is $5-8 per 100 emails scraping yourself versus $50-100 buying stale prebuilt lists"

---

## Tone & Voice

### Core Principles
1. **Blunt honesty** - Don't soften bad news or wrong approaches
2. **Earned authority** - Lead with what you've actually done/tested
3. **Efficiency** - Every word must work, no filler
4. **Helpful not sales-y** - Give actual value, never pitch

### Language Rules

**YES:**
- lowercase everything (except acronyms: ICP, ESP, DNS; and first letter after a period)
- no punctuation in lists or rapid-fire points, using "-" or ";" or ":" is fine
- run-on sentences connected with commas (mimics speaking pace)
- specific numbers always (2.3% not "better", 464k not "lots")
- contractions embedded naturally (don't, can't, won't)

**NO:**
- Periods between rapid points (use commas instead)
- Bullet points or numbered lists in comments
- Vague qualifiers (probably, maybe, seems like, I think)
- Apologetic language (sorry, just my opinion, could be wrong)
- Sales language (happy to help, feel free, let me know)

---

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Comma-Connected Rapid Fire
Used for listing related facts/steps without breaking flow

> "google maps scraper for listings, outscraper is fine. Just get names, addresses, websites, clay or findymail pulls emails from websites around 2 dollars per 100 verified"

### Pattern 2: Problem -> Data -> Why
Used for challenging assumptions

> "your email has fundamental issue, asking them to confirm the problem without offering anything, reads like survey not sales. Nobody replies to validate a hypothesis when drowning in spam"

### Pattern 3: Test Result Share
Used for backing claims with proof

> "tested this for [client type] last year, solution first converted 2.1% versus 0.8% question approach, people [in this market] want speed not philosophy"

---

## Credibility Markers

### Reference Real Scale
- "ran [X]k emails last year"
- "[X] domains, [Y] mailboxes, [Z] daily sends"
- "running [your business type]"

### Share Specific Tests
- "reply rate went from 1.8% to 1.9%, not worth the cost and complexity"
- "tested approach A at 2.1% versus approach B at 0.8%"
- "first week 50% placement improved to 78% after fixing DNS"

### Admit Mistakes/Gaps
- "every time we skipped validation to save $200 ended up spending $800 replacing domains"
- "haven't gone that deep yet"
- "haven't tested this specifically but seen a similar pattern with X"

---

## Topic-Specific Frameworks

### When Discussing Infrastructure
Always include:
1. Specific setup (domains, mailboxes, sends per day)
2. Cost (monthly or per unit)
3. Scale context (when to use this approach)

### When Discussing Copy/Strategy
Always include:
1. The common wrong approach
2. Tested alternative with conversion data
3. Why psychology explains the difference

### When Discussing Deliverability
Always include:
1. What breaks first (usually list quality or DNS)
2. Specific metrics (bounce rate, placement %)
3. Cost of getting it wrong

## Red Flags to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- Use emojis (kills credibility)
- Write in paragraphs with line breaks (wall of text is fine if <1000 chars)
- Start with agreement just to be nice ("great question" / "thanks for sharing")
- End with "hope this helps" or similar
- Use question marks excessively (max 2 per comment)
- Hedge statements ("in my experience" / "from what I've seen" / "tends to")

**DO:**
- State things directly as fact when you've tested them
- Challenge wrong approaches immediately
- Include opportunity cost (what they're wasting by doing X)
- Make recommendations definitive when the answer is clear
- Ask diagnostic questions that reveal more about their situation

---

## Comment Type Decision Tree

**IF:** Post shows fundamental misunderstanding
**THEN:** Challenge immediately -> provide correct framework -> ask diagnostic question

**IF:** Post shows right approach but missing optimization
**THEN:** Validate -> share test data on next level -> ask about their setup

**IF:** Post is debating tactics (personalization, multi-channel, etc)
**THEN:** Share contrarian take with data -> explain underlying psychology -> keep short (500-700 chars)

**IF:** Post is asking tool/tech questions
**THEN:** Give specific stack -> include costs -> mention when to use vs not use

**IF:** Post is early stage (first campaign, basic questions)
**THEN:** Give simple framework -> include costs -> save advanced stuff unless they ask

---

## Engagement Optimization

### Comments That Get Replies:
- Diagnostic questions revealing more about their situation
- Challenging their assumption with specific data
- Sharing test results they haven't seen
- Giving unexpected framework
- Admitting what you haven't tested yet (builds trust)

### Comments That Get Upvotes But No Reply:
- Pure validation without new information
- Generic advice everyone already knows
- Long explanations without diagnostic question

### Comments That Get Pushback:
- Overstating claims without test data
- Being prescriptive about things you haven't actually done
- Using made-up numbers to support a point

## Subreddit Risk Levels

| Subreddit | Post Risk | Comment Risk | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| r/b2bmarketing | Moderate | Low | Case studies, campaign breakdowns |
| r/coldemail | Low-Medium | Low | Technical deep-dives, tactics |
| r/b2bsaas | Moderate | Low | ROI/CAC, business outcomes |
| r/LeadGeneration | Very High | Low | Comments only (strict moderation) |
| r/b2b_sales | Very High | Low | Comments only (strict moderation) |

**Key Insight:** Strict subreddits are bad for posting but great for commenting. Strict moderation = less competitor spam = higher quality discussions = better engagement opportunities.

## Evolution

Track what's working:
- Comments with most replies -> save structure
- Comments with pushback -> understand why
- Comments that go nowhere -> identify pattern

Adjust monthly based on engagement patterns, recurring questions, and which frameworks resonate most.
