# Reddit Content Strategy Template

A playbook for using Reddit as a primary B2B marketing channel. Covers subreddit selection, post templates, engagement strategy, and conversion path from posts to booked calls.

## Channel Role

**Primary Goal:** Find active buyers discussing problems you solve -> provide value -> convert to discovery calls

**Tactical Execution:**
- 5-10 comments/day (responding to existing discussions)
- 1-2 posts/week (starting new threads with case studies, tactical breakdowns)
- Value-first engagement (never pitch in public comments)
- DM follow-up for qualified leads

**Why Reddit works:** Active B2B founders and marketers discuss these exact problems in real time. High intent. Better signal-to-noise ratio than most social platforms.

## Subreddit Selection Matrix

| Subreddit | Post Risk | Comment Risk | Best Content Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| r/b2bmarketing | Moderate | Low | Case studies, campaign breakdowns |
| r/coldemail | Low-Medium | Low | Technical deep-dives, tactics |
| r/b2bsaas | Moderate | Low | ROI/CAC, self-serve funnels |
| r/LeadGeneration | Very High | Low | Comments only (extremely strict moderation) |
| r/b2b_sales | Very High | Low | Comments only (very strict moderation) |
| r/digitalmarketing | Unknown | Unknown | Test with ROI-focused content |

**Key Insight:** Strict subreddits are bad for posting but great for commenting. Strict moderation means competitors can't spam either, so post quality stays high and you get better engagement opportunities.

## Proven Post Templates

### Template 1: Full Campaign Breakdown
**Best for:** r/b2bmarketing

**Title format:** "ran [specific activity] for [industry], here's what actually worked across [volume]"

**Structure:**
1. Opening: Context (industry, scale)
2. Numbers: Volume, results, key metrics
3. What was essential: Top 2-3 tactics that drove results
4. What we tested: Variations and outcomes
5. What didn't work: Honest about failures
6. Stack: Tools used (factual, not promotional)
7. No CTA: End with a data point, not an engagement hook

---

### Template 2: Tactical Deep-Dive
**Best for:** r/coldemail

**Title format:** "[specific tactic] generated [X]% of our [outcome]"

**Structure:**
1. Opening: One big campaign, tested many approaches, this one crushed everything
2. The insight: Why this tactic works (psychology, mechanics)
3. How we did it: Step-by-step process
4. Results: Specific metrics and comparisons
5. What didn't work: Alternative approaches and why they lost
6. ROI math: Cost comparison
7. Takeaway: One clear actionable insight

---

### Template 3: Business Outcome / ROI Focus
**Best for:** r/b2bsaas

**Title format:** "how we got [outcome] without [common expensive approach] using [your method]"

**Structure:**
1. Opening: The result (customers, revenue, pipeline)
2. Numbers: Volume metrics, CAC, conversion rates
3. The funnel: Step-by-step how it works
4. What made it work: Key success factors
5. ROI comparison: Your method vs. alternatives (SDRs, paid ads, etc.)
6. What didn't work: Honest about failures
7. Takeaway: When this approach makes sense vs. when it doesn't

---

### Template 4: Infrastructure Cost Breakdown
**Best for:** r/coldemail, r/LeadGeneration (test carefully)

**Title format:** "here's actual [costs/setup] for [specific volume tier] ([components])"

**Structure:**
1. Opening: Volume tier and what this setup handles
2. Cost breakdown: Line-by-line math
3. Infrastructure total: Monthly cost summary
4. Expected results: Engagement numbers based on benchmarks
5. What's NOT included: Be honest about execution costs, time, etc.
6. Takeaway: Infrastructure is the easy part, execution is where real cost lives

**Important:** Never calculate cost-per-lead from infrastructure alone. True cost includes execution, data/enrichment, and time. Show expected results, mention what's excluded, let readers do their own math.

## High-Performance Title Formula

```
"what it actually [costs/takes] to [specific outcome] ([component 1], [component 2], [component 3])"
```

**Why it works:**
- "what it actually" = implies insider knowledge, challenges conventional wisdom
- Specific outcome = searchable, clear value
- Components in parentheses = tells reader exactly what they'll learn
- Specific numbers beat vague claims every time

---

## Content Angles That Work

1. **Case studies with hard numbers** - full campaign breakdowns, what worked and what didn't
2. **Single tactic deep-dives** - one specific thing that drove majority of results
3. **Business outcome / ROI focus** - CAC comparisons, self-serve funnels, channel economics
4. **Infrastructure cost breakdowns** - transparent about real costs for specific volume tiers

### What NOT to Post
- Generic advice without data ("here's how to write cold emails")
- Tool reviews or comparisons (looks like affiliate marketing)
- Vague success stories without numbers ("we got great results")
- Anything with commercial language in strict subreddits
- Posts with CTA or engagement hooks ("happy to answer questions")

## Engagement & Conversion Strategy

### Conversion Path

**Stage 1: Post (Demand Capture)**
- Share case study or tactical deep-dive
- Zero CTA in the post
- Pure value, specific numbers, test data

**Stage 2: Comment Engagement (Value-First)**
- Reply to every comment within first hour (algorithm boost)
- Provide more tactical details
- Use diagnostic questions (70%) or direct recommendations (30%)
- Never pitch in public comments

**Stage 3: DM Transition (Qualification)**
- If someone asks "can you do this for me?" -> reply with value, then "DM me for specifics"
- In DMs: Share relevant case study + offer discovery call
- Qualify based on their business metrics

**Stage 4: Discovery Call (Conversion)**
- Booked via DM, not public comments
- Show ROI math, qualify fit

### Comment Response Framework

**Technical Question** (e.g., "What tool did you use?")
-> Give specific tool + cost + when to use vs. not use

**Strategy Question** (e.g., "Why does approach X work better?")
-> Share test data comparing approaches + explain the psychology

**Business Inquiry** (e.g., "Can you do this for my business?")
-> Share more specifics publicly + invite to DMs for their specific situation

## Posting Cadence & Timing

**Daily Activity:**
- 5-10 comments/day across relevant subreddits
- 1-2 posts/week with case studies or tactical content

**Engagement Protocol:**
- Reply to every comment within first 60 minutes (algorithm boost)
- Upvote every reply (encourages more engagement)
- Track which posts get most upvotes, comments, and DMs

---

## Success Metrics

**Primary:** Discovery calls booked from DM follow-up

**Secondary:**
- Upvotes (visibility)
- Comments (engagement quality)
- DMs received (buying intent)
- Reply engagement rate

**Monthly Targets:**
- Posts published: 4-8
- Comments made: 150-300
- DMs received: 5-10
- Calls booked: 2-5
