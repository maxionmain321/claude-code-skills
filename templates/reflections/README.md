## How to Use

### For Weekly Reflections

**When:** Same day, same time, every week. Block 30 minutes and protect it.

**Process:**
1. Copy `weekly/TEMPLATE.md` to a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Fill out all sections honestly (30 minutes)
3. Commit to your repo

**Example:**
```bash
cp templates/reflections/weekly/TEMPLATE.md reflections/weekly/2026-02-09.md
# Fill it out
git add reflections/weekly/2026-02-09.md
git commit -m "Weekly reflection 2026-02-09"
```

### For Monthly Reflections

**When:** First week of each month. Block 45-60 minutes.

**Process:**
1. Copy `monthly/TEMPLATE.md` to a new file named `YYYY-MM.md`
2. Fill out all sections including Part 6: Pattern Recognition
3. Commit to your repo

## Customization

Before your first reflection, customize:
1. **Lead Measures table** - replace placeholder activities with your actual GTM channels
2. **STARTS habits** - define 5 habits you want to build
3. **STOPS habits** - define 5 habits you want to break
4. **Revenue targets** - set your MRR goal in the monthly template

## Template Philosophy

The template forces:
1. **Honesty over optimism** - "No story, just data"
2. **Revenue focus** - Track what actually generates money
3. **Action over analysis** - "What's one action to address this constraint?"
4. **Habit accountability** - Check STARTS and STOPS every week
5. **Constraint thinking** - Identify the one bottleneck preventing 2x growth
